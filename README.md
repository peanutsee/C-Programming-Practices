# C-Programming-Practices
Repo for some of my C-Programming. Most questions are from my girlfriend. Some are from codewars :) Please enjoy.

## Agenda
Prepare for part 2 of CZ1103 Introduction to Computational Thinking in C

## How to consume?
Well, just read the codes and the problem statements! 

## Can I practise on these practices?
Please go ahead :)
