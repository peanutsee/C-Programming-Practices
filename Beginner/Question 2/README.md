Write a program that prompts the user for two numbers. Call them n1 and n2. Keep prompting
the user until the sum of n1 and n2 is divisible by 3. Then display all numbers between n1(inclusive) and n2
(inclusive) in increasing order. Note that n1 may be smaller than n2, equal to n2, or greater than n2. You need
to handle all scenarios.
