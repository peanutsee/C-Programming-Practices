Implement the swap_digit_pairs function. It takes in an integer n (type: int), and returns
an integer whose value is the pairwise digit swap of n.
a. swap_digit_pair(1234) will return 2143. 1 and 2 are swapped. 3 & 4 are swapped.
b. swap_digit_pair(56789) will return 57698. 6 & 7 are swapped. 8 & 9 are swapped. 5 (the first
digit) is left alone.
